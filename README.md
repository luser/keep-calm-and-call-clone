Made in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). `keep-calm-and-call-clone.svg` is the original source file. It uses the [Keep Calm](https://www.dafont.com/keep-calm.font) font. `keep-calm-and-call-clone-rendered.svg` has the text rendered to paths so the font is not required. `keep-calm-and-call-clone.png` is the rendered PNG you see above.
